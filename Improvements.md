Here are some high-level improvement points for the next version of this MVP project:  

Configuration Management:  
Use a more robust configuration management library like Spring Boot's @ConfigurationProperties to handle configuration files.
Support multiple environments (development, testing, production) with different configuration files.

Monitoring:  
Implement monitoring and alerting for the server using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Security Enhancements:  
Implement authentication and authorization for the server to restrict access.
Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for client-server communication.

Error Handling and Resilience:  
Improve error handling with custom exceptions and more informative error messages.
Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers to handle transient failures.

Scalability and Performance:  
Optimize the server to handle more concurrent connections and larger data volumes.
Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling for the server.

Testing and CI/CD:  
Increase test coverage with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

Documentation and User Experience:  
Improve documentation with detailed setup guides, API documentation, and usage examples.
Enhance the user experience with better error messages and more informative logs.

Code Quality and Maintainability:  
Refactor the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.
Implement static code analysis tools like SonarQube to ensure code quality.

Feature Enhancements:  
Add support for more file types and more complex filtering criteria.
Implement a web-based dashboard for monitoring and managing the server and clients.

Deployment and Containerization:  
Containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment and scaling.
Use orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
